Python Libary for ordering food from site: Dáme Jídlo

## How to use

First we need to create class which stores info about customer:

```
cust = Customer("name", "surname", "email", "address")
```

Next we need to search for restaurants in area:

```
searched = search(cust)
```

Now we can find hole menu from restaurant. 
Pass the chosen restaurant as a argument

```
restaurant1 = menu(searched, 13)
```
